Moved the local development directory and removed irrelevant
directories/files. Now you should copy the developed scripts from the develop/
folder to somewhere else to run the simulations.

Now the main development (and tracking by git) is done for
'd400nm_E70GPa_nu0.17_rho2.65g_cc/'. The other directories only contain copies
from this folder with slight modifications for different simulation
conditions and simulation results/analysis, which are not tracked by git.

Modified the FF++ simulation, not calcHmel, to output displacement in m
instead of nm. I still keep the previously simulated results in the sols/
directories and care must be taken for conversion to Hmel and any other use.

Simulation of elastic mode in ellipse+10um-thick substrate.
The output of FF++ simulations are to be converted to Hmel using
calcHmel and imported to OOMMF simulations.
The current version of calcHmel (v0.901.1) treat the displacement
as in unit of m, not nm, which is what the FF++ simulations actually
output. As a result, the magnetoelastic field in the OOMMF simulations
is overestimated. You would probably like to adjust the amplitude of
Hmel by a factor of 1e-3 or even smaller.

For future work, I will modify calcHmel to handle the unit correctly.
For now, keep this in mind.
